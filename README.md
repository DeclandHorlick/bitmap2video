Generate video from Bitmaps or a Canvas.

Create mp4 video from Bitmaps or anything you can draw to a hardware accelerated Canvas.  Pure Android MediaCodec implementation.  Rrequires no third party libs or NDK.

Currently supports MP4 and both H264 and H265, but easily extensable for other formats.  See CreateRunnable for an example.
